Hey! I've recently graduated (December '16) with an MSc in computer science from  the [Australian National University][anu]. My primary interests are in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Over the coming months I'll be putting up blog posts and code about ideas and projects that I'm working on.

In 2012, I worked with Professor [Craig Savage][craig] on physics education research for teaching special relativity. My BSc [Honours thesis][BSc thesis] and [a Physical Review publication][AS2013] were the result. In 2013, I worked on novel signal processing techniques for the [LIGO] project. In 2015, I worked at an awesome social network startup based in Canberra called [Karma]. My [Masters thesis][MSc thesis] was in artificial general intelligence, under [Jan Leike][jan] and [Marcus Hutter][marcus]. An accompanying JavaScript demo relating to [AIXI] and its variants can be found [here][demo]. I will be presenting a [paper][JLH2017] based on this work at [IJCAI] in Melbourne later this year.

The easiest way to contact me is by email:
