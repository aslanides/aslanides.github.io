I'm an Australian artificial intelligence researcher based in London, working at [DeepMind]. I was born in [Canberra] in 1990 to my loving parents, the poet [Timoshenko Aslanides] and political scientist [Jenny Stewart].

I graduated from the [Australian National University] in 2016 with an MSc in computer science. My [Masters thesis] was on reinforcement learning under the joint supervision of [Jan Leike] and [Marcus Hutter], and resulted in an [IJCAI publication][ALH2017] and accompanying web [demo]. Prior to this, I worked on [Karma], a new kind of social network based around open letters of gratitude and founded in Canberra in 2015. I've also worked as a consultant to [ACT Health] and [iungo], a smart car startup based in Sydney. In 2013 I worked on signal processing techniques for the [LIGO] project and on conditional random fields at the (now-defunct) [NICTA]. In 2012 I graduated from the [Australian National University] with a BSc in physics. My [Honours thesis] was in physics education research under the supervision of [Craig Savage], and resulted in a [Physical Review publication][AS2013]. I'm also (sadly!) a lapsed pianist; in 2011 I earned the [AMusA] diploma in piano performance.

The easiest way to contact me is by email:
