Yo! I'm a MSc student in [Marcus Hutter's](http://hutter1.net) reinforcement learning group at the [Australian National University](http://anu.edu.au), expecting to graduate in December 2016. Watch this space! I'm planning to put up code, blog posts, and more in the near future.

In the meantime, you can check out my [Github](https://github.com/aslanides) and my [CV](../docs/cv.pdf). My [bachelor's thesis](../docs/honours_thesis.pdf) is pretty old, and riddled with errors, but I thought I'd put it up anyway -- it's not as cringe-inducing to me as it once was.
