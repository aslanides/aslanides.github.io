Yo! I'm a MSc student in [Marcus Hutter's][marcus] universal AI group at the [Australian National University][anu], expecting to graduate in December 2016. Watch this space! I'm planning to put up code, blog posts, and more in the near future.

In the meantime, you can check out my [GitHub] and my [CV]. In 2012, I worked with Professor [Craig Savage][craig] on physics education research for teaching special relativity. My [Honours thesis][BSc thesis] and [a Physical Review publication][AS2013] were the result. In 2015, I worked at an awesome social network startup based in Canberra called [Karma]. In 2016, I worked with [Jan Leike][jan] on a JavaScript [demo] to demonstrate properties of [AIXI] and its variants. My Masters thesis can be found [here][MSc thesis].

The easiest way to contact me is by email:
