Yo! I'm a MSc student in [Marcus Hutter's](http://hutter1.net) reinforcement learning group at the [Australian National University](http://anu.edu.au), expecting to graduate in December 2016. Watch this space! I'm planning to put up code, blog posts, and more in the near future.

In the meantime, you can check out my [Github](https://github.com/aslanides) and my [CV](../docs/cv.pdf). In 2012, I worked with Professor [Craig Savage](http://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~cms130/) on physics education research for teaching special relativity. My [Honours thesis](../docs/honours_thesis.pdf) and [a publication](http://journals.aps.org/prper/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.9.010118) were the result. In 2016, I've been working with [Jan Leike](https://jan.leike.name/) on a demo to demonstrate properties of [AIXI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI) and its variants.
