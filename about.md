Yo! I'm a MSc student in [Marcus Hutter's](http://hutter1.net) reinforcement learning group at the [Australian National University](http://anu.edu.au), expecting to graduate in December 2016. Watch this space! I'm planning to put up code, blog posts, and more in the near future.

In the meantime, you can check out my [Github](https://github.com/aslanides) and my [CV](../cv.pdf).
